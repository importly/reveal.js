            <h3>Paradox</h3>
            This positive and negative interchange of ideas created an
            unconscious sense of credibility within the reader. Thus, the
            Paradox supports the theme.

            However, the focus turns away from the different types of men to the

            <p>Tone and Mood Shift</p>

              Before shift:
              Resilience and Ambiguity 
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
              Words such as ‚Äúrave‚Äù and ‚Äúburn‚Äù (2), along with the heavy anaphora, show that the narrator is crying out for his father to be resilient. However, with this logic, the narrator is still trying to convince his father to fight death, creating ambiguity

            <p>Tone and Mood Shift</p>
            
              After shift:
              Desperate and Sympathy 
            <p class="fragment">The oxymoron of the word ‚Äúcurse‚Äù followed by ‚Äúbless‚Äù highlights the heartbrokenness of the narrator, and thus his desperateness to save his father. The mood after the shift is sympathetic, as that is the emotion we feel after witnessing the desperateness of the narrator.</p>
